Game theory is one of the success stories of modern economics. Since its inception as a sub-discipline of operations research, it has since become part of the standard toolbox of social scientists, biologists, psychologists, political scientists—even some historians! This course is an introduction to the methods and applications of game theory; it is designed to stimulate careful thinking about the use (and misuse) of mathematics as a way to predict strategic behaviour. It also provides empirical evidence on these interactions.

### Assessment and readings
- This course will be assessed through 7 homework assignments, due (before midnight) on the Friday of weeks 2 to 8.
- Lecture material taught in Hilary Term 2017 serves as this course’s backbone. Before each tutorial, it is important that you study each of the corresponding lectures, at least those which are underlined in the course outline below.
- The textbook for this course is Osborne, M *An Introduction to Game Theory*. Oxford University Press (henceforth MO). It is useful in order to flesh out some of the material covered in less detail in the lectures and tutorials. Each chapter includes exercises for extra practice.
- In each of the four parts, some topics will be covered in detail during tutorials while others will be left to self-study and problem sets. However, if there are specific points or readings you would like to discuss, you can supersede my choice of topics by emailing me on the day right before class.

## II. Applied game theory: Who gets what–and why?

### 1. Auctions and mechanism design

- Auction theory ({{% staticref "files/auctions.pdf" %}}my lecture notes{{% /staticref %}})
- Mechanism design ([Lecture 16](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/3f835e88-7f0e-4569-ac15-933a4f9c323c/Add%202016-17%20resources/Peter%20Eso/GT17-L16-EfficientMD.pdf))

#### Assignments
*Week 6*: Essay (see {{% staticref "files/gt-additional_assignments.pdf" %}}Additional assignments{{% /staticref %}}), which must be between 900 and 1100 words in length (excluding references). Your answer should demonstrate in-depth understanding of the question in relation to concepts from the course, but will also be assessed on the quality of written expression, the argumentative structure, and engagement with the literature.<br>
*Week 7*: Problems A, B and C (see Additional assignments); [problem set 7](https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/7627d499-7ccd-47ae-a5f4-d12167b757fd/Add%202016-17%20resources/Peter%20Eso/GT17-W7-Class.pdf), problem 2.

This course provides a theoretical and empirical toolkit for the analysis of financial phenomena. In particular, it will cover how financial assets are valued; how businesses raise finance; how corporations are controlled; the role of corporate taxation and regulation; theories behind the financial crash; and the issues which arise in an international financial economy.

### Logistics

Tutorial and consultation hours TBD.

### Assessment and readings

- This course will be assessed through 8 homework assignments, due at 12pm on the day before each tutorial (or a week after the last tutorial).

- There will be compulsory readings every week. Several of those are drawn from Brealey, R. A., S. C. Myers and F. Allen. 2011. *Principles of Corporate Finance* (10th ed.), henceforth BMA. Other suggested readings will not be covered in tutorials by default, but feel free to email me in advance (at least one day before) if you wish to discuss them.

- At the end of each tutorial session, I will try and leave some time to discuss financial news or any other topics which might be of particular relevance or interest to the course. Again, I am happy to take suggestions ahead of time.

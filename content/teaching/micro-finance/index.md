The goal of this course is to develop a conceptual and practical skillset required to operate a micro-finance initiative. It begins by identifying problems with current micro-finance practices, then delves into specific issues to do with behaviour, regulation, business, and poverty alleviation. Essays and discussions on theories and real-world examples are complemented with two hands-on assignments: coding and running an automated lending platform (which won the [2019 Finance & Blockchain Hackathon at Imperial College London](https://www.iwoca.co.uk/insights/hackathon-imperial/)) and designing a feasible business proposal for a new micro-finance enterprise.

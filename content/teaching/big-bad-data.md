This presentation was part of a webinar series for the [Youth Delegate Program](https://www.theidhouse.com/ydp/), a one-year fellowship program for young actors of international development from all around the world. It served as an introduction to the know-hows of data science: where to find data, how to collect data on your own project or organization, and how (not) to use it to guide decisions and evaluate the impact of interventions.

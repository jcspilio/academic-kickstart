I'm a graduate student within the Department of Economics and Oriel College, University of Oxford. My research and teaching focus on applied mathematics: operational research (Markov decision processes and games), statistics (econometrics, machine learning, network inference) and simulation (ABMs). I'm especially interested in problems involving technology, sustainable development and finance.

I'm the president of [Economists Without Borders Oxford](https://www.economistswithoutborders.co.uk/), a *pro bono* consultancy offering various data analysis and consulting services to NGOs, social enterprises and nonprofits.

Previously I've taught and/or worked at the University of Oxford, Stanford University, LSE, the University of Sydney, Université Paris-Dauphine and the Parliament of Monaco.

I enjoy pseudorandom walks in nature, scuba diving, debating, improvisational theatre/piano and [aleatoricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoricism)—of which this site's header, *color-wander* by [Matt DesLauriers](https://www.mattdesl.com/), is a shining example!
